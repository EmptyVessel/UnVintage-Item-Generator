# UnVintage Item Generator
An item generator and backpack simulator for old versions of Team Fortress 2.
## Overview
The purpose of this tool is to create inventories for older versions of TF2 that have been cracked using one of the many Steam emulators used during the late 2000s/early 2010s. This tool visually and functionally simulates TF2's backpack system and allows you to edit it freely. With it, you may generate item files for Revloader, RevEmu, and SSE (SEE BELOW).<br>This tool is meant for personal and educational use only. Distribution of this tool is not allowed.
## How to Use
1. Extract the tool to the location of your choosing. Ensure the file structure is not tampered with.
2. Open the "unvintage.html" file in your browser of choosing.
3. Click the top right "?" button for more details.
## Known Issues
- SSE is not properly implemented yet. Might work in small numbers of items with older versions of SSE, but no further. I invite anyone who knows more in-depth about SSE's item generation to get in contact with me.
- Although the tool is partially crafted to work with more modern versions of TF2, it may not function 100% properly.
<br>Feel free to make me aware of any other issues you may encounter.
